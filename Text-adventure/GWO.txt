You kill it! Climbing down, you sever it's head for a trophy, and then
 go home.It's been an eventful day.
/E 
Your spear wounds the boar, but you can't quite get a killing blow. 
It eventually dies of blood-loss, and you take it's head as a trophy,
feeling slightly embarrased to do so. And then it's off home,as you
were up the tree long enough.
/E
You are eventually rescued, but never,  ever talk about it ever again.
